# Sluf's Seared Tuna Pasta

This quick meal scales easily depending on the size of the dinner crowd. Pro tip: use a ceramic skillet to get a sear with the properties of nonstick, and get it reasonably hot without burning the butter.  DM @Barry_Coggins for questions or watch this recipe at https://go.sluf.com/seared-tuna-pasta.

## Ingredients

- 1 4oz tuna steak
- cracked black pepper
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 serving angle hair pasta
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- hot water reserved from the cooked noodles
- 4-5 pieces dried mushrooms (or thinly sliced fresh mushrooms)
- dried or fresh parsley for granish

## Instructions

1. Cook the noodles to your likeness but have the remaining steps complete before your noodles are cooked so they do not overcook.  Reserve some of the hot water in a small bowl and soak the mushrooms and parsley.  They should be able to soak for at least 5 minutes before using them.
2. Prepare the tuna by cracking black pepper on a small, flat plate.  Place the tuna on the pepper and crack additional pepper on the top side.  I personally like about 50% of the surface area covered with moderately large pieces.
3.  Heat the skillet over medium high heat.  Add butter when hot, and wait for the butter to melt completely.  Just as it is melted but before it burns, add the tuna steak.  It will not stick to ceramic, but it will cook quickly.  Cook for 45-60 seconds on the first side and then flip.  Cook 30-45 seconds on the second side.  Carefully using a spatula, stand the tuna on end and briefly touch each side to the hot skillet to seal the edges.  Remove the tuna steak from the hot pan and let rest on a cutting board.
4.  Prepare the sauce by mixing the oils, vinegar, and soy sauce in a small dish.  Drain the noodles and move them to the individual serving bowls.  Add the sauce mix to each bowl and stir the hot noodles to coat with the sauce.  
5.  Thinly slice the rested tuna steak using a very sharp knife and transfer to the dressed noodles.  Drain the rehydrated mushroom and parsley, and add to the top of the sliced tuna.
